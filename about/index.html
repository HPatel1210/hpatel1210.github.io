Adolescence is a high-risk/high-reward period. We know some basic facts:

•	The brain develops until 25, and adolescence is a period of risk and potential defined by
        the interaction of heredity, environment and biology.

•	Lifelong mental health and substance disorders often have onset in adolescence.
        Adolescents can do lasting harm to the still-developing brain.

•	We can help adolescents minimize risk and nurture their vast potential. Adolescence is
        an opportunity to prevent lifelong impairment by intervening with evidence-based treatments
        and educational approaches.

Mental health when taken care of in growing years of  a child can results in their better academic performance,
better personal individual relationships and their own personality development is affected very positively . 

Parents can’t help adolescents all alone, and we must also work on reaching young people where they spend most of
their time: in middle school, high school, and college. This report has highlighted promising school-based interventions
and mental health literacy programs, and we must take the next step: identifying and implementing effective mental-health
education on a meaningfully large scale.

We aim to provide sufficient mental health care to the students in the right age by including it in their academics,
hence also providing them academic credits. 

Overall, the implementation of ML to mental health in our application has demonstrated a range of benefits across
the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration. With the majority of studies
identified focusing on the detection and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is
significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and mental health.

According to the concept of Gross National Happiness (GNH) that was promulgated by His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck,
the Fourth King of Bhutan in the early 1970s. When His Majesty spoke about GNH at the time, he questioned the prevailing
measurement system that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) alone could deliver happiness and well-being to society.

The four pillars of GNH are:-
Good Governance-	Good Governance is a considered a pillar for happiness because it determines the conditions
                    in which an individual thrive.

Sustainable Socio-economic Development-	A thriving GNH economy must value social and economic contributions
                                        of households and families, free time and leisure given the roles of
                                        these factors in Happiness.

Preservation and Promotion of Culture-	Happiness is believed to be contributed to by the preserving ones culture.
                                        Developing cultural resilience, which can be understood as the culture’s
                                        capacity to maintain and develop cultural identity, knowledge and practices,
                                        and able to overcome challenges and difficulties from other norms and ideals.

Environmental Conservation-		Environmental Conservation is considered a key contribution to GNH because in addition
                                to providing critical services such as water and energy, the environment is believed to
                                contribute to aesthetic and other stimulus that can be directly healing to people who
                                enjoy vivid colors and light, untainted breeze and silence in nature’s sound.

The four pillars are further elaborated into nine domains, which articulate the different elements of GNH in detail and form
the basis of GNH measurement, indices and screening tools.

•	Living standards
•	Education Health
•	Environment
•	Community
•	Vitality
•	Time-use
•	Psychological well-being
•	Good Governance
•	Cultural resilience and promotion

In accordance with these 9 domains, Bhutan has developed 38 sub-indexes, 72 indicators and 151 variables that are used to define
and analyse the happiness of the Bhutanese people.

The Formula is:</pre>


<pre style="color:white;text-align:center;padding-top: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 200px;">

 GNH = 1 - { (a1 + a2 + a3 + ……. + a72) /72 }

Where, a1…a72 are the 72 indicators.
